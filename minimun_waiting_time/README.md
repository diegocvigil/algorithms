### Minimum Waiting Time

**Goal** : Write a function that returns the minimum amount of total waiting time for all of the queries. You're given a non-empty array of positive integers representing the amounts of time that specific queries take to execute. Only one query can be executed at a time, but the queries can be executed in any order.
